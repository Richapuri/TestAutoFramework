This is code for a test automation framework that I have designed and developed using C#, Selenium and Nunit framework. The C# pattern I have used is page object modelling (also called as POM).
The application under test is Swaglabs. The link for the web application can be found below:
https://www.saucedemo.com/
Please note I have created few functional test cases and automated them using C#, Selenium and Nunit framework. 
Test cases can be categoried into 3 categories. Login test cases, Inventory Page test cases and End to End test cases.
Test cases are as follows:
Login Test cases:
Test Case 1. Log into the application with correct user name and password.
Test case 2. Log into the application with incorrect user name and correct password.
Test case 3. Log into the application with correct user name and incorrect password.
Test case 4 Log into the application with incorrect user name and incorrect password.
Inventory page test cases:
Test case 5. Print all the items in the inventory page. This will list all items as logs.
Test case 6. Print an item (first item) in the inventory page.
Test case 7. Print an item from item name.
Test case 8. Print an item price from item name.
Test case 9. Click on Add to cart button for a specific item.
Test case 10. Log out of the application.
Test case 11. Navigate to About page of the application.
End to End test case
Test case 12. This is an end to end test case where a full flow of buying an item is automated.
