This is code for a test automation framework that I have designed and developed using C#, Selenium and Nunit framework. The C# pattern I have used is page object modelling (also called as POM).
The application under test is Swaglabs. The link for the web application can be found below:

Please note I have created few functional test cases and automated them using C#, Selenium and Nunit framework. 
Test cases are related to logging into the SwagLab application.
Test cases are as follows:
Login Test cases:
Test Case 1. Log into the application with correct user name and password.
Test case 2. Log into the application with incorrect user name and correct password.
Test case 3. Log into the application with correct user name and incorrect password.
Test case 4 Log into the application with incorrect user name and incorrect password.
